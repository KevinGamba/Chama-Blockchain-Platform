### Project Name: Chama Chain

# Chama-Blockchain-Platform
A decentralized financial platform for Chama groups, allowing members to contribute, track, and access their savings and loans securely.
Blockchain integration prevents defaults and ensures transparency. 
It also reduces transaction costs and enhances accessibility for the unbanked population due to high prohibitive charges.

### Problem Statement:
Kenya’s informal financial groups, known as "Chamas," face challenges such as defaults on contributions, high mobile money transfer fees, 
and limited tracking of member credibility. This threatens the financial security of women who rely on Chamas for investments, school fees, and business growth.

### Approach:
Building a decentralized finance platform tailored for Chamas, using Aptos blockchain to record contributions, track defaulters, and reduce transaction fees by using Aptos blockchain payments. A transparent ledger ensures credibility and identity tracking across regions.

### Vision:
To empower women and small community financial groups with transparent and cost-effective tools to build sustainable wealth and avoid defaults.

### Technological Stack:

- Blockchain platform: Aptos

- Smart Contracts: To handle contributions, payouts, and member tracking

- User Interface (UI): Flutter or React Native for mobile apps

- Digital Identity: Aptos identity layer to track members’ credibility
